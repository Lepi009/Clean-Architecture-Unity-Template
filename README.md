# A Unity Template for Clean Architecture
This is the repo to my master's thesis "Modular Game Architecture in Unity: A Case Study of Clean Architecture and Platform Optimization in Unbreachable".

## Abstract of my thesis
Publishing games across multiple platforms is becoming more attractive. However, it introduces significant architectural complexity due to requirements and different APIs. This thesis addresses the challenge of designing a modular, maintainable software architecture for multi-platform Unity games. Using the Design Science Research methodology, an architectural artifact is designed, implemented, and evaluated using a real-world use case, Unbreachable, an ongoing game project by Buckfish.

The designed architecture uses established design patterns combined with principles of Clean Architecture. This includes event-driven communication, dependency injection, and the Model-View-Presenter pattern. The use case was evaluated using code metrics, Windows and Steam Deck runtime benchmarks, and tests in the Unity Editor.

The results indicate that the software architecture improves maintainability and scalability, while still providing a desired performance. These findings demonstrate that architectural principles can be effectively applied to game development in Unity projects. The research contributes a validated software architecture, a Unity template, and empirical insights in developing scalable and maintainable games.
